# Usage

To get data from or write data to a plc, two things are needed.

- An instance of a concrete [***IPlc***](#IPlc-Implementations).
- At least one [***IPlcItem***](#PlcItems).

The first is responsible for establishing the connection to the plc and how to read or write.  
The later defines what kind of data and where to read it from or write it to the plc.
___

# IPlc Implementations

The following concrete implementations for accessing a plc are currently available as separate NuGet packages:

## Plc.Mock

| .NET Framework | .NET Standard | .NET |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| :heavy_check_mark: 4.5.0 | :heavy_check_mark: 2.0 | :heavy_check_mark: 5.0 |

This provides a mocked plc, that stores its data in-memory. It can be used for test and simulation purposes.

### Initialization

When creating an instance of the **_MockPlc_** class, initially available datablocks can be specified optionally. This implementation automatically creates or expands datablocks as they are accessed. 

``` csharp
var initialDataBlocks = new Dictionary<ushort, byte[]>()
	{
		{65, new byte[] {0,1,2,3, 255} },
		{1245, new byte[] {0,1,2,3, 255} },
	};
IPlc plc = new MockPlc(initialDataBlocks);
```

:grey_exclamation: Like all other ***IPlc*** implementations this one has to be disposed once it is not used anymore.

## Plc.AgLink

| .NET Framework | .NET Standard | .NET |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| :heavy_check_mark: 4.5.0 | :heavy_check_mark: 2.0 | :heavy_check_mark: 5.0 |

This implementation utilizes the proprietary **AGLink** library owned by **Delta Logic** for communicating with the plc via **S7 TCP/IP**.

:grey_exclamation: **AGLink** is a commercial product owned by **Delta Logic**. Using the ***Plc.AgLink*** package requires their software, so make sure you are allowed to.

### Build

:grey_exclamation: This repository does not contain the necessary **AGLink** libraries and auxiliary files needed to build the projects. Those files must be provided individually.

#### Plc.AgLink

To get the project ***Plc.AgLink*** to build, at least the .Net wrapper assembly **AGL4DotNET.4.dll** must be put into the _â¬™\AgLink_ folder of the project. Optionally the **AGL4DotNET.4.xml** documentation file can be added too. Afterwards this project should be compilable. Bear in mind that the wrapper assembly will not be copied to the output folder during compilation, nor will it be part of the created **NuGet** package. Its only purpose within the ***Plc.AgLink*** project is to get it to properly build. Supplying all needed **AGLink** libraries and files must be done via other means. One way is described [below](#Plc.AgLink.Demo).

#### Plc.AgLink.Demo

Besides the .Net wrapper assembly **AGL4DotNET.4.dll** **AGLink** requires other files to properly run. The below table lists all those files.

|        File        |      Required      |     Origin     |                    Description                     |
| :----------------: | :----------------: | :------------: | :------------------------------------------------: |
|  AGL4DotNET.4.dll  | :heavy_check_mark: | AGLink package |               .Net wrapper assembly                |
|  AGL4DotNET.4.xml  | :grey_exclamation: | AGLink package |              .Net documentation file               |
|    AGLink40.dll    | :heavy_check_mark: | AGLink package | Native connection assembly for 32 bit architecture |
|  AGLink40_x64.dll  | :heavy_check_mark: | AGLink package | Native connection assembly for 64 bit architecture |
| AGLink40_Error.txt | :grey_exclamation: | AGLink package |       Contains error code to message mapping       |
|   AGLink.license   | :grey_exclamation: |     custom     |             Contains the license code              |

:grey_exclamation: Can be omitted in a custom implementation, but is required for the ***Plc.AgLink.Demo*** to build.

Typically a separate project should be created that provides those files. The ***Plc.AgLink.Demo*** is an example of one such project. The idea behind it is, that all required files are added to a _Resources\AgLink_ folder of the project. The project directly references the .Net wrapper assembly **AGL4DotNET.4.dll** from this folder. Therefore it will be copied to the output folder of referencing assemblies. The other required files will be copied to the output folder via a special build target defined in ***Phoenix.Data.Plc.AgLink.Demo.targets***.

To provide the license code for the **AGLink** library the file _AGLink.license_ can be used. The content of this file will be parsed during initialization of the ***AgLinkPlc*** class and used to register the product.

To provide better error messages the file _AGLink40_Error.txt_ should be added to the output folder. The content of this file will be parsed during initialization of the ***AgLinkPlc*** class and later on be used to resolve error codes to clear messages.

### Initialization

To create an instance of the ***AGLinkPlc*** class, the ***AgLinkPlcConnectionData*** has to be supplied. It basically contains the ip address and some additional information about the plc.

``` csharp
var connectionData = new AgLinkPlcConnectionData(deviceNumber: 0, ip: "127.0.0.2", rack: 0, slot: 0);
IPlc plc = new AgLinkPlc(connectionData);
```

:grey_exclamation: Like all other ***IPlc*** implementations this one has to be disposed once it is not used anymore.
___

# PlcItems

An **_IPlcItem_** contains all data needed to read or write to the plc.

| Property | Data Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| Type | Enum ***PlcItemType*** | Input, Output, Flags, Data |
| DataBlock | **UInt16** | The datablock of the item. This is 0 for all types except ***PlcItemType.Data***. |
| Position | **UInt16** | The zero-based byte-position. |
| BitPosition | Enum ***BitPosition*** | X0, X1, ... , X7 |
| Value | **_BitCollection_** | Specialized class that holds the bits and bytes of the item. |


To make working with plc items easier, specialized items for the most common data types exist in the namespace **_Phoenix.Data.Plc.Items.Typed_**. Those items automatically convert the underlying **_BitCollection_** into more concrete types:

- BitPlcItem
- BytesPlcItem
- EnumPlcItem
- Int16PlcItem
- Utf8PlcItem
- WordPlcItem
- [DynamicPlcItems](#DynamicPlcItems)
- ...

## Initialization

Creating a new ***IPlcItem*** can be done either by using the constructor of any concrete item or more guided via builder pattern.

**Constructor**
``` csharp
var item = new Utf8PlcItem(0, 4, 10, identifier: "UTF-8");
```

**Builder**
``` csharp
var itemBuilder = new Phoenix.Data.Plc.Items.Builder.PlcItemBuilder();
var item = itemBuilder
	.ConstructUtf8PlcItem("UTF-8")
	.AtDatablock(0)
	.AtPosition(4)
	.WithLength(10)
	.Build()
	;
```

## Reading / Writing plc items

Reading or writing is done via the following methods of any **_IPlc_** instance:

**Read a collection of _IPlcItem_'s from the plc.**
``` csharp
Task ReadItemsAsync(ICollection<IPlcItem> plcItems, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
```

**Write a collection of _IPlcItem_'s to the plc.**
``` csharp
Task<bool> WriteItemsAsync(ICollection<IPlcItem> plcItems, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
```

As to not pollute the **_IPlc_** interface with unnecessary methods, some extension methods for other common read or write operations are provided via the **_PlcExtensions_** class:

**Read a single _IPlcItem_ from the plc.**
``` csharp
Task<TValue> ReadItemAsync<TValue>(this IPlc plc, IPlcItem<TValue> plcItem, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
```
``` csharp
Task<BitCollection> ReadItemAsync(this IPlc plc, IPlcItem plcItem, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
```

**Write a single _IPlcItem_'s to the plc.**
``` csharp
Task<bool> WriteItemAsync(this IPlc plc, IPlcItem plcItem, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
```

**Write a single or multiple _IPlcItem_'s to the plc and validate the result.**
``` csharp
Task<bool> WriteItemWithValidationAsync(this IPlc plc, IPlcItem plcItem, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
```
``` csharp
Task<bool> WriteItemsWithValidationAsync(this IPlc plc, ICollection<IPlcItem> plcItems, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
```

## DynamicPlcItems

Those are special ***PlcItems*** that can be used for dynamic data where the length of the item is not known during design time but rather encoded within the first few bytes of the item itself. A typical usage scenario are strings of different sizes, where the actual string length is the first byte of the item itself.

Each ***IDynamicPlcItem*** internally consists of two separate ***PlcItems***.

|  |  |
| :- | :- |
| ***LengthPlcItem*** | This is the item whose value is the actual length of the second item. The ***LengthPlcItem*** itself has a fixed size and must be an ***INumericPlcItem***. |
| ***FlexiblePlcItem*** | This is the item whose length is dynamic. It can be any normal ***IPlcItem*** but actually only ***BytesPlcItem*** and ***TextPlcItem*** are currently implemented as dynamic items. |

Reading and writing an ***IDynamicPlcItem*** always consists of two steps. When reading such an item the ***LengthPlcItem*** will be read first to obtain the current length and afterwards the data of the ***FlexiblePlcItem*** is obtained. Writing is the opposite.

:grey_exclamation: Since reading and writing is done in two steps, it cannot be guaranteed, that the data of an ***IDynamicPlcItem*** is consistent.

Dynamic items additionally provide some special properties that may come in handy under certain conditions.

|  |  |
| :- | :- |
| ***LengthFactor*** | This factor will be applied to the length of a dynamic item. It should be used if the ***LengthPlcItem*** does not provide an absolute byte amount, but rather an amount of items. |
| ***LengthLimit*** | This is an optional limit that will be applied to the length being read or written. |

# PlcMonitor

Sometimes it may be necessary to monitor data within a plc and react if this data changes. This can be done with one of the concrete [***IPlcMonitor*** Implementations](#IPlcMonitor-Implementations). The ***IPlcMonitor*** can be used on its own, or wrapped together with an ***IPlc*** as an ***IMonitorablePlc***. Later should be used, if monitoring data is done regularly. This way the two dependencies ***IPlc*** nad ***IPlcMonitor*** can be replaced by just a single ***IMonitorablePlc***.

# IPlcMonitor Implementations

## PollingPlcMonitor

| .NET Framework | .NET Standard | .NET |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| :heavy_check_mark: 4.5.0 | :heavy_check_mark: 2.0 | :heavy_check_mark: 5.0 |

This monitor internally uses an ***IPlc*** and regularly polls monitored ***IPlcItems*** and checks if their data has changed. It provides the ***PollingMonitorablePlc*** wrapper class that combines both the plc and the monitor instance.

### Polling Frequency

The frequency at witch ***IPlcItems*** are polled has a default value of _300 milliseconds_. This is defined by ***PlcItemMonitorConfigurations.DefaultPollingFrequency***. Although this interval should be sufficient enough for most cases, it can be changed to a different value.

:grey_exclamation: Changing the default monitoring frequency does not change the interval at which already monitored items are polled.  
:grey_exclamation: The minimum polling frequency is _50 milliseconds_ and cannot be undershot.

In case the normal frequency is good enough expect for some critical items, the ***PollingPlcMonitor*** accepts special ***PlcItemMonitorConfigurations*** that define different frequencies for named ***IPlcItems***. A single ***PlcItemMonitorConfiguration*** for an ***IPLcItem*** simply consists of the ***IPlcItem.Identifier*** and a custom polling interval that will be applied to the it. The ***PlcItemMonitorConfigurations*** are implicitly convertible from a **Dictionary<string, uint>**, so it is possible to pass one such dictionary to the constructor of the ***PollingPlcMonitor***. This is done so custom configuration can be stored externally (in some kind of settings file) without the storage provider needing to know anything about the special configuration classes.

### Initialization

**Create a new _PollingPlcMonitor_ instance.**
``` csharp
IPlc plc = new IPlc();
IPlcMonitor plcMonitor = new PollingPlcMonitor(plc);
```

**Create a new _PollingMonitorablePlc_ instance.**
``` csharp
IPlc plc = new IPlc();
IMonitorablePlc monitoredPlc = new PollingMonitorablePlc(plc);
```

**Create a new _PollingMonitorablePlc_ instance via fluent syntax.**
``` csharp
IMonitorablePlc monitoredPlc = new IPlc().MakeMonitorable();
```

**Create a new _PollingMonitorablePlc_ instance via fluent syntax and custom polling frequency configuration.**
``` csharp
IMonitorablePlc monitoredPlc = new MockPlc().MakeMonitorable
	(
		new Dictionary<string, uint>
		{
			{"FastItem", 200},
			{"LightspeedItem", 50},          
			{"SlowItem", 1000},
		}
	);
```

# Logging

The ***Phoenix.Data.Plc*** package provides its own small logging facility in form the ***ILogger*** interface and the static ***LogManager*** which is internally used to provide concrete logger instances. Via the static property ***LogManager.LoggerFactory*** the kind of provided ***ILogger*** can be changed externally.

```csharp
// Create a custom ILogger instance and let the log manager use it.
Phoenix.Data.Plc.Logging.ILogger logger = new ...
Phoenix.Data.Plc.Logging.LogManager.LoggerFactory = () => logger;
```

***Phoenix.Data.Plc*** comes with the following ***ILogger*** implementations:

- ***NullLogger***: An implementation that does nothing. This is the default.
- ***TraceLogger***: An implementation that uses **System.Diagnostics.Trace** to output log messages.

The ***LogManager*** has another static property ***LogAllReadAndWriteOperations*** which instructs the ***Plc*** base class to log all read and write operations. This is disabled by default, as it could be a very costly operation depending on the amount of operations.

```csharp
// Conditionally log all read and write operations of the plc.
#if DEBUG
	Phoenix.Data.Plc.Logging.LogManager.LogAllReadAndWriteOperations = true;
#else
	Phoenix.Data.Plc.Logging.LogManager.LogAllReadAndWriteOperations = false;
#endif
```

___

# Helper

The ***Phoenix.Data.Plc.Mock*** package contains a static helper class ***ByteArrayExtensions*** that provides some extensions methods build to help manipulating data with byte arrays. Basically those methods allow for automatically converting basic data types into byte data and then writing this data to any byte array. For values that surpass the size of a single byte, the corresponding endianness has to be specified.

The following functions are available:

```cs
// Applies a boolean array.
var data = new byte[45];
var booleans = new bool[] { true, true, false, false };
data.ApplyValue(bytePosition: 10, booleans);
data.ApplyValue(bytePosition: 10, bitPosition: BitPosition.X3, booleans);
```
```cs
// Applies a byte.
var data = new byte[45];
var @byte = byte.MaxValue;
data.ApplyValue(bytePosition: 10, @byte);
```
```cs
// Applies another byte array.
var data = new byte[45];
var bytes = new byte[] {byte.MaxValue, byte.MaxValue};
data.ApplyValue(bytePosition: 10, bytes);
```
```cs
// Applies a short (Int16).
var data = new byte[45];
var @short = Int16.MinValue;
data.ApplyValue(bytePosition: 10, @short, DataConverter.Endianness.BigEndian);
```
```cs
// Applies an ushort (UInt16).
var data = new byte[45];
var @ushort = UInt16.MaxValue;
data.ApplyValue(bytePosition: 10, @ushort, DataConverter.Endianness.LittleEndian);
```
```cs
// Applies an int (Int32).
var data = new byte[45];
var @int = Int32.MinValue;
data.ApplyValue(bytePosition: 10, @int, DataConverter.Endianness.BigEndian);
```
```cs
// Applies an uint (UInt32).
var data = new byte[45];
var @uint = UInt32.MaxValue;
data.ApplyValue(bytePosition: 10, @uint, DataConverter.Endianness.LittleEndian);
```
```cs
// Applies a long (Int64).
var data = new byte[45];
var @long = Int64.MinValue;
data.ApplyValue(bytePosition: 10, @long, DataConverter.Endianness.BigEndian);
```
```cs
// Applies an ulong (UInt64).
var data = new byte[45];
var @ulong = UInt64.MaxValue;
data.ApplyValue(bytePosition: 10, @ulong, DataConverter.Endianness.LittleEndian);
```
```cs
// Applies a string.
var data = new byte[45];
var @string = "Foo";
data.ApplyValue(bytePosition: 10, @string, Encoding.ASCII);
```


Those methods directly operate on the original byte array and additionally also return it back to the caller which allows for chaining multiple commands.

```csharp
var data = new byte[45]
	.ApplyValue(bytePosition: 10, value: ushort.MaxValue, DataConverter.Endianness.BigEndian)
	.ApplyValue(bytePosition: 15, value: long.MaxValue, DataConverter.Endianness.LittleEndian)
	.ApplyValue(bytePosition: 30, value: "Bar", Encoding.ASCII)
	;
```
